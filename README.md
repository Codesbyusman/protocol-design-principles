This white paper defines a set of design principles for protocols, created to address fundamental changes in internet use and the continually developing threat landscape. As threats and use cases evolve, internet protocols should too. The principles in this white paper put user needs at the heart of the design process to make sure that protocols provide functionality and security for users. This set of principles doesn’t attempt or claim to cover every aspect of protocol design, but it does cover some of the most vital issues.
